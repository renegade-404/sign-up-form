Overall setting:

1. How I should split the content?
    - container inside the body
    - container split into two children
    - left child is an image
    - in the right child there is a container and a form
2. Right child
    - the upper part is an explanation and invitation
    - the middle part is a form with:
        - how you want to be called like
        - your title
        - secret code
        - confirm secret code
    - the bottom part is still a form with:
        - a button
        - question whether the user has entered the realm before
3. Left child
    - background is an image generated by chat GPT
    - on top of the image there is a low opacity stripe background
        - inside there is an icon and a name
    - at the bottom of the image there is a catch-phrase

Pseudocode:

1. Normalize everything
2. Create a div inside the body
3. Give display: flex to the div
4. Give the right child flex: 2 and the left one flex: 1
